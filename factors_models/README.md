- `income_data`, `balance_data`, `cash_flow_data`, `market_data`, `financial_ratio_data` (Financial and market data)

#### **Output / What the File Returns:**
- Returns a DataFrame with value factors like P/E ratio, market cap, and net profit.

#### **What Exactly This File Is Performing and How It Is Performing:**
- **Value Class**: Calculates value-related financial metrics to assess a stock's intrinsic value.
  - **Methods**:

    1. **`safe_get_value()`**
       - **Purpose**: Safely retrieves a value from a given column in a DataFrame, handling missing or NaN values.
       - **How**: This method accepts a DataFrame and column name as input, checks if the value exists, and returns it. If the value is missing or NaN, it returns zero.

    2. **`safe_get_value_ttm()`**
       - **Purpose**: Retrieves a value from the trailing twelve months (TTM) of a specified column, handling missing data and ensuring the proper time-based calculation.
       - **How**: It looks for the TTM value in the provided DataFrame and column, returning zero if the value is missing or NaN. This ensures the proper treatment of time-series data.

    3. **`calculate_financial_liability()`**
       - **Purpose**: Computes the total financial liabilities of the company, which helps assess its financial stability.
       - **How**: It uses the `safe_get_value()` method to extract the values for total debt, short-term debt, and other liabilities, then calculates the total liability as the sum of these values.

    4. **`calculate_cashflow_price()`**
       - **Purpose**: Computes the operating cash flow to price ratio, which helps assess the companyâ€™s ability to generate cash relative to its market price.
       - **How**: This method divides the operating cash flow (retrieved using `safe_get_value_ttm()`) by the stock price to compute the ratio.

    5. **`calculate_priceToBook()`**
       - **Purpose**: Computes the price-to-book (P/B) ratio, a common measure used to assess the market's valuation of a company's equity relative to its book value.
       - **How**: This method divides the stock price by the book value per share (calculated using `safe_get_value_ttm()` for total equity) to compute the P/B ratio.

    6. **`calculate_price_to_sales()`**
       - **Purpose**: Computes the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which helps assess the market's valuation of a company's revenue.
       - **How**: This method divides the stock price by the total revenue per share, providing a valuation metric based on revenue.

    7. **`calculate_price_to_earnings()`**
       - **Purpose**: Calculates the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a widely used indicator of stock valuation relative to its earnings.
       - **How**: It divides the stock price by the earnings per share (EPS) from the income data, producing the P/E ratio.

    8. **`calculate_ltd_to_ta()`**
       - **Purpose**: Computes the long-term debt to total assets ratio, which measures a company's financial leverage and risk.
       - **How**: It calculates the ratio by dividing long-term debt by the total assets of the company, providing an indication of financial risk.

    9. **`calculate_net_profit()`**
       - **Purpose**: Calculates the net profit over the trailing twelve months (TTM), which is a key indicator of profitability.
       - **How**: It extracts the net profit data from the income statement using `safe_get_value_ttm()` and returns the calculated value.

    10. **`calculate_ebit()`**
        - **Purpose**: Computes Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT), a key measure of profitability.
        - **How**: This method calculates EBIT by extracting the necessary data from the income statement using `safe_get_value_ttm()`.

    11. **`calculate_working_capital_ratio()`**
        - **Purpose**: Calculates the working capital ratio, an indicator of a companyâ€™s operational efficiency and short-term financial health.
        - **How**: It calculates working capital as the difference between current assets and current liabilities and divides this by total assets.

    12. **`calculate_quick_ratio()`**
        - **Purpose**: Computes the quick ratio, which is used to assess a company's short-term liquidity by excluding inventory from current assets.
        - **How**: This method divides the difference between current assets and inventory by current liabilities to compute the quick ratio.

    13. **`calculate_operating_cashflow_to_total_assets()`**
        - **Purpose**: Measures the efficiency of a company in generating operating cash flow relative to its total assets.
        - **How**: It divides operating cash flow by the total assets (both retrieved using `safe_get_value_ttm()`), providing an efficiency metric.

    14. **`calculate_ev_to_operating_cashflow()`**
        - **Purpose**: Calculates the Enterprise Value to Operating Cash Flow ratio, a measure of the companyâ€™s valuation relative to its ability to generate cash.
        - **How**: The method divides the enterprise value by operating cash flow to compute this ratio.

    15. **`calculate_operating_cashflow_to_net_profit()`**
        - **Purpose**: Computes the operating cash flow to net profit ratio, providing insight into the quality of earnings.
        - **How**: This method divides operating cash flow by net profit, indicating how much of the net profit is actually being generated as cash.

    16. **`calculate_debt_to_ebitda()`**
        - **Purpose**: Calculates the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which helps assess the companyâ€™s ability to repay its debt using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
        - **How**: This method divides the companyâ€™s total debt by EBITDA, giving an indicator of financial leverage and ability to service debt.
